# Adaptive Controller for Teleoperated Wrist Rehabilitation Robot

This repository contains the code and documentation for my Bachelor Thesis:  
**"Designing Adaptive Controller for Teleoperation for Hybrid Force-Position Control for Wrist Rehabilitation Robot."**

## Overview

This project focuses on developing an **adaptive controller** for a wrist rehabilitation robot aimed at improving **remote therapy precision and safety** through hybrid force-position control. The system enables effective teleoperation, allowing therapists to interact with patients remotely while ensuring stability and comfort.

## Key Features

- ‚úÖ **Adaptive Hybrid Control**: Combines force and position control for responsive and stable therapy interactions.
- üì° **Teleoperation Architecture**: Enables remote control with real-time feedback using a master-slave configuration.
- üìä **MATLAB/Simulink Simulation**: System modeled and validated in a high-fidelity simulation environment.
- üß† **Biomechanical Modeling**: Accurately represents the dynamics of the wrist joint during rehabilitation.
- üõ°Ô∏è **Robust Control**: Designed to maintain stability across varying patient interaction forces.
- üìà **Signal Processing**: Ensures reliable sensor data for real-time control and feedback.

## System Architecture

- **Master Device**: Therapist interface for sending motion and force commands.
- **Slave Robot**: Wrist rehabilitation device executing hybrid control commands.
- **Communication Link**: Transmits commands and feedback in real time.
- **Sensor Integration**: Captures position and force data to adaptively update control signals.
